        <h1>Hi!</h1>
        <div class="line"></div>
        <p>Welcome To St. James', Kolkata
            Not much is known about our founding fathers,
             but this much is certain that it began with a vision - a vision for children who, irrespective of
              language, creed or colour would grow up in an institution devoid of racial 
              prejudices, would be able to express themselves fearlessly and be taught by teachers \
              totally committed to the cause of sound, all-round, value based education. 
                 St. James' School was established in 1864. 
                 It was inaugurated by the then Most Revd. 
                 George Edward Cotton- the Bishop of Calcutta on 25th July 1864.
                  Almost from its inception, reports show that these were years  of stress and struggle.
                   In the first twenty years of its existence the school faced intensive
                   \ financial difficulties and had to be closed in December 1904.
                    According to reports, there was an upsurge of sentiment on the part of parents,
                     well wishers and old boys at the closure of the school.
                      In 1907, with financial assistance from the Church Education League .</p>
